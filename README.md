## Description
  The Stock-Market app was created with the idea
  of bringing the User with the opportunity of
  having a user-friendly interaction with the
  stock market. The application was created with
  MERN (Mongoose, Express, React and Node) we
  used this framework because it has full
  functionality and can make the calls between
  the Client and the Server in an efficient
  manner. The User can create an account that
  will be saved in the database, also, while the
  passwords created are encrypted using the most
  advance technology in the industry.

  The information from the User gets linked to his account, 
  in this way, it’s possible that the user can see his balance, 
  the stocks he owns and buy more if needed. 
  
  The front end was created to be responsive, by
  doing this, we can be sure that the User can
  use the app in any electronic device he owns,
  it works well in laptops, tablets, and
  cellphones. This way we can be sure than the
  app reaches more Users since it’s easy to
  access and has an advance UX/UI. 
  
  The app is in its beta version, right now it
  can be functional, but the stock prices are
  not equal to the ones in the stock market,
  this is a feature that we will add soon,
  because we need a third-party API that allows
  us to make calls every second, making sure
  that the price is the real time market price.
  Also, we will add a payment provider, this way
  we can be sure that the User can fund his
  account and have full access to the stock
  market. This will be made using stripe, that
  way we can be sure that the credit information
  is safe, and the User can use the page safely.
